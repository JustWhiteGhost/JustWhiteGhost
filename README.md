**Game Development -** I've been Learning to Program and have been programming since an early age in C++, C#, Pyhton, Java, Javascript, Gd Script, HTML and so on. My Preferred Game Engine is Unity but the recent fumble of their made me check out Godot which in my humble view is quite good for 2d games *(3d is ok too but i prefer unity or unreal honestly)*

**Art/3d Modelling -** Creating Enviromental Art, Props, Weapons, Artifacts and Shaders. Texturing Using Substance Painter or Hand painting, Although I am not quite Good at 2d or Characters Yet

**Story Writing/Boarding -** Extremely Bad at it(absolute 0 iq and Creativity). Would Love if someone gives tips and tricks
